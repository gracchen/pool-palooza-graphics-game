probably start with just two balls first that can generalize to more?

#### Brainstorm of Tasks (tentative)

- scene setup, table, walls, balls, lighting, ball class/properties (ie. velocity, center point) fixed diameter, friction coef, etc.
- update velocity & pos method in ball class, + a helper to call it for every ball
- collision detector helper function (btwn balls w/ center points & the walls)
- collision handling helper function to update ball(s) velocity vectors
- camera switch between birds-eye & cue-ball-following (button trigger for now)

#### midway demo: 
- w/out mouse-picking maybe some fixed way to show collision/shooting. 

#### after midway demo:
- mouse-picking (not taught yet, maybe see prev project examples) aiming
- creativity brainstorm, some twist?
